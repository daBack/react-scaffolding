# React scaffolding by daBack
## What is this?
I created this skeleton mostly for personal use, since I am lazy and wanted an easy way to
create a new fresh website with the most essential functionalities. Several times.
This rep is based on create-react-app but is filled with a few more fancy and useful... *things*?

## Installation
1. Download this repo, through either zip or command line.
2. npm install
3. Write some nice code.
4. Go get that award for best website.
