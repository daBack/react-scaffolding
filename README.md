# React scaffolding by daBack
## What is this?
I created this skeleton mostly for personal use, since I am lazy and wanted an easy way to
create a new fresh website with the most essential functionalities. Several times.
This rep is based on create-react-app but is filled with a few more fancy and useful... *things*?


## Fonts
A lot of good fonts can be found on google fonts, however Inter UI strikes beyonds others.
To see more what Inter offers, check it out here: [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/)
You can find the fonts available with the repo in: `public/fonts/InterUI/inter-ui.css`.

## Installation
1. Download this repo, through either zip or command line.
2. To download node modules (essentials packages): `npm install`.
3. To start your server: `npm start`.
4. Go write some awesome code.
